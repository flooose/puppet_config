IMPORTANT:
This is not meant to be a public project. It only serves
as an access point for some server configurations.

If you choose to use this, beware, there are security
issues, bad code and DEADLY LIONS here.

Good luck!

TODO:
-- add support for the following command-line options
  1 ruby base path (edit init.d/puppet) to properly point
    to this path
  2 server/client install so that /etc/hosts can be properly
    edited
  3 specify address of server, if install is a client install
  4 add support for adding 'puppet' user and group so that
    'puppet-masterd --mkusers' doesn't have to be used.

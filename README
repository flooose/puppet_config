Good luck!

TODO:
-- add support for the following command-line options
  1 ruby base path (edit init.d/puppet) to properly point
    to this path
  2 server/client install so that /etc/hosts can be properly
    edited
  3 specify address of server, if install is a client install
  4 add support for adding 'puppet' user and group so that
    'puppet-masterd --mkusers' doesn't have to be used.

cp init.d/puppet /etc/init.d (perm: 755)
cp default/puppet /etc/default (perm: 644)

########## Notes to self #################
for server set up:

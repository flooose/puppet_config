There are two types of manifests here:

1. Manifests for servers or groups of servers. This is how
puppet recommends doing it. These manifests manifest manage
things for their respective servers/groups of servers.

2. Manifests representing things that are likely to be
in common to all or most servers. These are generally
environment files like config files like bashrc and vimrc.
